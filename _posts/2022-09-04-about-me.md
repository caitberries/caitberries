# About Me Post

Hi, my name is Caitlyn Berryhill (she/they), and I’m a senior at [Christopher Newport University](https://cnu.edu/) in Newport News, Virginia. I’m originally from Lynchburg, Virginia, where the Blue Ridge Mountains can be seen for miles, but am currently studying Social Work, with minors in Sociology and Childhood Studies and am closer to the coast than I have been in 15 years. ![Profile Picture](https://caitberries.github.io/caitberries/images/profilepic.jpg)

Our Digital Humanities class was one that was recommended to me by a friend in the Social Work department who had taken it the previous semester and found the skills she obtained in the class to be beneficial for our particular career paths. I have enjoyed writing recreationally for the majority of my adolescence, spending most of my time conjuring up short stories and poems, but now use it more for therapeutic purposes, so I figured taking a writing course would give me the opportunity to brush up on my writing skills and learn new ways of communicating professionally (and digitally) with others. 

After graduating from Christopher Newport University, I plan to go to graduate school for my Masters of Social Work and become licensed as a social worker. The schools I’m currently planning on applying to are [Virginia Commonwealth University](https://socialwork.vcu.edu/academics/master-of-social-work/), [University of Maryland](https://www.ssw.umaryland.edu/), and [University of North Carolina](https://ssw.unc.edu/). I hope to be able to study abroad during my time in graduate school, as the pandemic took my ability to do that at CNU away. The thought of being able to learn about other countries’ conceptions of social work and sociology and to gain an international perspective on various humanitarian issues sounds overwhelmingly exciting to me. After graduate school, however, I hope to pursue a number of careers throughout my adult life, with a particular interest in helping children and families. If I *had* to pick one dream career, I would want to be a play therapist, a career that equips a special form of therapy specifically for children and adolescents that strategically uses play and games to assist clients’ abilities to process and work through complex or traumatic emotions or events, evaluate behavioral changes, and help clients to meet their needs and goals.

Being in the Social Work Program at CNU means that I have had ample opportunities to volunteer within the Newport News and Hampton community. I started my freshman year volunteering at the [NATASHA House](https://www.natashahouse.org/) serving homeless women and children in the CHAMPS Program, which focuses on youth character development through tutoring, mentoring, and creative arts, and continued to do so intermittently throughout my sophomore and junior year, as the pandemic would permit. Currently, as a senior, I am interning at [The Denbigh House](https://communitybraininjury.org/), a clubhouse for survivors of traumatic brain injury, twice a week. I haven’t had much time to get to know the program, but in the short time I have been interning, I can already tell it will be a good match. Aside from volunteering, though, I am participating in the creation, organization, and distribution of a survey examining parents of the Newport News and Hampton areas’ attitudes towards the meritocracy of public schools, with the intention of creating an article of the research’s findings, hopefully by the end of the school year.

Academics aside, I am an _avid_ cat-lover (see my calico cat, Penny!), major book nerd and _Harry Potter_ fan, and have done photography since I was a sophomore in high school. But really, at the end of the day, academics encompass a major part of my life, personality, and passion. Even after my time in school is over, I hope to never stop learning, growing, and changing with the world around me, and to help people from all walks of life.
