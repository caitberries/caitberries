# Review Blog #1: Mapping the Second Ku Klux Klan, 1915-1940
### The Project and its Purpose

[Mapping the Second Ku Klux Klan, 1915-1940](https://labs.library.vcu.edu/klan/), is an eponymous Digital Humanities project created by the library of Virginia Commonwealth University. It serves as a rough timeline for the rise of the second Ku Klux Klan between 1915 and 1940. The interactive map provided by the website allows users to watch the number of local units, or Klaverns, belonging to the second Ku Klux Klan rise across the United States during the aforementioned time period, represented by a red dot that users can mouse over to learn more information about the chronology of the Klaverns as they pop up across the country, the patterns of Klan organizing and recruitment, and the courageous individuals who resisted and fought against the Klan. 

This project is based on the second rise of the Ku Klux Klan for how widespread it was across the United States, a striking difference to the first and third rise, which were concentrated in the Deep South. This far-reaching nature of the second rise of the Ku Klux Klan was found significant to researchers, as it indicates that parts of the Klan’s appeal, like its use of racism, anti-Semitism, and anti-Catholicism, were widespread across the United States as well. 

### Assessment of the Humanistic Claims and Evidence

### Assessment of Technology Used

When entering the website, there is a pop-up message, which contains a description of the project itself and the map’s purpose in creating a visualization of the second Klan spread throughout the US, and gives users have the option to view and explore the map’s timeline of the rise of the second Ku Klux Klan or to navigate to the “Learn More” section, where readers can find the purpose of the project, the timeline and patterns of the second Ku Klux Klan, as well as the limitations of basing the project’s data on documentary evidence, meaning that the project does not provide an exact chronology of the Klan’s rise and fall from power. An in-depth essay is also linked in the “Learn More” section, which gives a thorough summary and timeline of the rise of the Ku Klux Klan, allowing readers to see the influx of recruitment for Klans as they read along with the essay. There are no instructions for how to operate the map itself, but the mechanics of the map are relatively self-explanatory. 

### Usability Issues

The map of the second Ku Klux Klan was relatively easy to navigate, as it’s structured the same as most websites’ interactive map features. However, if I didn’t have the website open full screen, I ran the risk of missing out on the interactive timeline, as it would only show up if the window was taking up a certain portion of the screen. All links on the website work and add value to the project. The mobile version of the website, however, was a bit difficult to navigate. The map was no longer interactive, which I felt was disappointing and detracted from the value of the information able to be shared about the second rise; instead, the visual substituted for the interactive map looked more like a gif that repeatedly showed the second rise of the Klu Klux Klan throughout 1915-1940, but the years are not displayed as the map goes through the timeline. It did, however, add an element where one could go state-by-state to see a list of cities where klans were founded in order of their corresponding years of establishment.
