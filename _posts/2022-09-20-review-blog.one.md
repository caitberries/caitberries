### The Project and its Purpose

[Mapping the Second Ku Klux Klan, 1915-1940](https://labs.library.vcu.edu/klan/), is an eponymous Digital Humanities project created by the library of Virginia Commonwealth University. It serves as a rough timeline for the rise of the second Ku Klux Klan between 1915 and 1940. The interactive map provided by the website allows users to watch the number of local units, or Klaverns, belonging to the second Ku Klux Klan rise across the United States during the aforementioned time period, represented by a red dot that users can mouse over to learn more information about the chronology of the Klaverns as they pop up across the country, the patterns of Klan organizing and recruitment, and the courageous individuals who resisted and fought against the Klan. 

This project is based on the second rise of the Ku Klux Klan for how quickly it became widespread across the United States, a striking difference to the first and third rise, which were concentrated in the Deep South. This far-reaching nature of the second rise of the Ku Klux Klan was found significant to researchers, as it indicates that parts of the Klan’s appeal, like its use of racism, anti-Semitism, and anti-Catholicism, were widespread across the United States as well. 

### Assessment of the Humanistic Claims and Evidence

The Mapping the Second Ku Klux Klan, 1915-1940, project is credited to lead author John Kneebone, a professor of History at VCU, and five other individuals working for the VCU library. The map and its corresponding website’s main purpose is to visually demonstrate the second rising of the Ku Klux Klan and distribute historical information relevant to the events that led to its increased popularity across the United States and its ultimate and quick demise and the implications of such– that the beliefs held by the Klan were appealing to a wide variety of individuals that lived during the timeframe represented. 

The data collected by researchers is accessible to readers in the “Learn More” section, and though it was many documents to sort through, the information provided on the researchers sources’ and detailed notes of each Klans’ klavern name, location, and founding year were thorough and easy to understand for the average individual. Though the interactive map is interesting and an important visual for mapping the rise and fall of the Second Ku Klux Klan, the project does a good job of demonstrating how it engages with history mostly through the “Learn More” section of the website, which goes in-depth in explaining how studying this portion of history is relevant and important in understanding the impact the Ku Klux Klan had on the United States’ culture at the time, regardless of its inevitable failure. 

### Assessment of Technology Used

When entering the website, there is a pop-up message, which contains a description of the project itself and the map’s purpose in creating a visualization of the second Klan spread throughout the US, and gives users have the option to view and explore the map’s timeline of the rise of the second Ku Klux Klan or to navigate to the “Learn More” section, where readers can find the purpose of the project, the timeline and patterns of the second Ku Klux Klan, as well as the limitations of basing the project’s data on documentary evidence, meaning that the project does not provide an exact chronology of the Klan’s rise and fall from power. 

An in-depth essay is also linked in the “Learn More” section, which gives a thorough summary and timeline of the rise of the Ku Klux Klan, allowing readers to see the influx of recruitment for Klans as they read along with the essay. There are no instructions for how to operate the map itself, but the mechanics of the map are relatively self-explanatory. 

### Usability Issues
<img width="429" alt="website map with interactive timeline no longer visible, instead reads We Are Uncommon in its place" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112186152/191650075-b2161bd7-798f-444d-bbd1-bc77e536113e.png">

The map of the second Ku Klux Klan was relatively easy to navigate, as it’s structured the same as most websites’ interactive map features. However, if I didn’t have the website open full screen, I ran the risk of missing out on the interactive timeline, as it would only show up if the window was taking up a certain portion of the screen. All links on the website work and add value to the project. 

The mobile version of the website, however, was a bit difficult to navigate and the map was no longer interactive. I found this to be disappointing and thought it detracted from the value of the information able to be shared about the second rise, as viewers could no longer see the accurate timeline in action, an essential piece to project's purpose; instead, the visual substituted for the interactive map looked more like a gif that repeatedly showed the second rise of the Klu Klux Klan throughout 1915-1940, but the years are not displayed as the map goes through the timeline. It did, however, add an element where one could go state-by-state to see a list of cities where klans were founded in order of their corresponding years of establishment.
