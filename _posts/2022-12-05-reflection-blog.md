### First Impressions
When I came to the first digital humanities class this year, I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect. I understood that the class was technologically driven, which I was nervous about, but other than that I had to go in with an open mind and wait to be taught. A form of study entirely dedicated to combining technological advances like social media with humanitary disciplines was and is still fascinating to me. I hoped the class would give me the opportunity to grow in my ability to write professionally, and looked forward to the knowledge to be gained in the many DH projects we reviewed over the semester.

The more I learned about digital humanities, though, the clearer its importance became to me. I first defined digital humanities as “scholars using digital technologies in their practice of studying and publishing information pertaining to a certain academic subject within the humanities”. While I do still feel this definition encompasses the basics of what digital humanities is, I understand now that digital humanities is much more complex than I previously assumed and enjoyed learning more about it through the assigned readings and my peers.
 
### Class Assignments
The assigned readings for class I felt did supplement my understanding of course content, and if anything, I wish that there were more of them. The readings allowed me to develop a clearer understanding of the ins and outs of digital humanities, like Nielson Norman Group’s “Text Scanning Patterns: Eyetracking Evidence” and Digital Humanities Toolkit’s “Wireframing”, and encouraged me to try my best in the class, even if I thought it wouldn’t be good work, like Anne Lamott’s “Shitty First Drafts”.

Personally, I struggled the most with learning how to navigate GitHub, as I had never attempted any form of coding before. I was unaware that coding would be a core part of the course requirements, but the instructions provided for how to set up our blogs was helpful. However, I do think I would have benefited from going to office hours to have the process explained to me. Once I got the hang of what was expected of me and learned how to best format my blog posts, the assignments felt much more manageable to undertake. It was really encouraging to learn that I was capable of doing well on assignments that weren’t a current part of my skill set and didn't immediately click in my mind. 

The grant writing, however, felt much more my speed. Gaining an understanding of the voice and tone necessary to not only write the grant proposal, but to write persuasively enough to convince a board to fund the project’s creation was a cool process. I felt like the grant assignments allowed me to develop a voice for myself within digital humanities and really explore what digital humanities meant in the context of the real world. 

The peer reviews for the grant proposal as well, though I didn’t necessarily enjoy them, gave me the chance to see what other students’ interpretation of digital humanities was and just how expansive and diverse the discipline is. Though, I feel I would have enjoyed the peer reviews more if the expectation from the beginning of class was to come to peer review classes with a pre-determined word count already prepared, or even just an outline of the assignment, as I entered into the class with a difficulty in creating rough drafts for the assignments. 

### Final Thoughts
Overall, I feel I can confidently say that this class has benefitted me as a writer and student. If I could tell my past self one thing about this course, I would encourage them to not underestimate their ability to succeed at things that don’t come naturally to them and to be open to growing and asking questions when necessary.
